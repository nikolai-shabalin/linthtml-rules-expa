# Contributing to linthtml-rules-expa

We welcome you to our project! We are happy to receive your input and suggestions for improving the HTML linting rules. Before you get started, please read this document to see how you can contribute.

## Contribution


The following are the ways you may choose to make your contribution:

1. **Creating Questions and Suggestions**: If you have questions or ideas, you can create a new “issue” in the [“Issues”](https://github.com/nikolai-shabalin/linthtml-rules-expa/issues) section on GitHub. Make sure you describe the issue or suggestion in as much detail as possible so we can easily understand what it's about.

2. **Solving Issues**: If you want to contribute by solving an open issue or adding new functionality, read the “Development Workflow” section below to learn how to get started.

3. **Testing**: We welcome testing and feedback from the community. If you have the opportunity to test HTML linting rules and provide feedback on performance or possible improvements, it would be greatly appreciated.

## Development Workflow.
If you would like to contribute to the development of our HTML linting workflow, follow these steps:

1. First find or create a new issue to solve a problem or create a new rule. Don't try to go create a PR right away. It may not be useful.
3. Discuss the implementation of the problem in the issue in detail.
4. Only after all the steps, proceed with the implementation, for that:
5. Make a fork of this repository.
6. Make all the necessary changes and commit.
7. Create a new Pull Request on GitHub and expect review and feedback.

## Communication
If you have questions or need help, feel free to contact us. You can contact us by creating an “issue” in the Issues section.

Thank you for your participation and contribution to our project!
